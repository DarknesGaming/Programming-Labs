These labs are written in Java, and I have designed them to teach the noobs the basics of Java.

Because I am a student in Computer Science, I can only upload labs after I complete them. The labs
are documented so you can learn what these methods do faster.

Labs currently in existence:

Lab 1 (ASCII Art)(September 8, 2016)
Uses "System.out.println()" to create ASCII Art.

Lab 2 (September 13, 2016)
Uses double values, and "System.out.println()" to display the numbers that have been calculated.

Lab 3 (September 16, 2016)
Uses more double values, more equations and the "System.out.println()" method to display more
numbers from more complex calculations.

Lab 04A (September 20, 2016)
Algebraic functions are used to perform algebraic math equations. Only one of these are introduced
in Algebra II, which is a high school course.

Lab 04B (September 28, 2016)
We use Graphics to draw a few 2D objects, and a 3D cube.

Lab 05A (October 3, 2016)
Input your own numbers, and get your answers from the defined math equations.

Lab 05B (October 6, 2016)
We calculate how much money you have been charged based on how fast you were speeding, and if you
were in a school zone.

Lab 05C (October 11, 2016)
We draw lines and circles inside a grid, and use "for" loops to complete this.

Lab 05D (October 17, 2016)
We draw a flag of the United Kingdom.

Lab 06A (October 24, 2016)
We use the random method defined in the Expo java file to create strange things in a grid.

Lab 06B (October 26, 2016)
We draw a house and practice modular programming while defining a new class in just one java
source code file.

Lab 07 (November 1, 2016)
We create class files within class files, doing more modular programming, and doing some more
math and input.
