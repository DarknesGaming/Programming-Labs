# Python Labs
-----------------
These are the labs that I actually do for fun, and I am currently teaching myself Python by using guides and e-books I find online. I really need to buy an actual book.

Python can be used for many things, and will soon become the main programming language for Computer Science. Python is easy for those who want to become programmers, but experienced programmers won't like it for its syntax.

Python is known for its flexibility, and for its usefulness in hacking. You can actually write some applications in Python that can become your hacking tools, but be sure to use those powers for good.

More Python labs will be added as I continue to self-teach. Enjoy these while you can.
